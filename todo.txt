1. create transformer for each different pages

2. add the folder structure for in transformers
	Like:
	> Transformers (folder)
		> Marketplace (folder)
			> Service (folder)
				> IndexTransformer.php (contains all the data)
				> CartTransformer.php (custom)
				> CardTransformer.php (custom)
				> OfferedTransformer.php  (custom)(user)
				> PurchasedTransformer.php (custom)(owner)

3. Maintain your code to look-alike in all class and function

4. All models should use direct relation with each other; meaning I dont want to access third model from first model query

5. Remove the bulk (ie. relations) from User model; it is getting heavy 

6. Start using the Model::query in controller; dont use eager/lazy loading over from user

7. All the media files should go through uploads/medias table & upload_id/media_id should exist in the data that has media
	Like:
		"image" in "services" should have "upload_id", and "featured_image" json field should have array of "upload_ids"

8. Try to create helper functions for each job

9. Compress each media files
